# HTML canvas experiments

These are some Javascript HTML canvas experiments. There are several files here, the most interesting one is sunset3.js. Everything from here one regards this file.

The idea is to create an animation with canvas. The app uses HTML canvas functions to create Tile-elements that can be manipulated separately. There is also an animated text created with HTML canvas.

Click on the image to start animation, doubleclick to reset.
